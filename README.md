# silent-auction
A website for hosting an online "silent auction"; initially created for Mason Community Players' "Not-So-Silent Auction" event.

This is a fairly straightforward Meteor app, so it runs in the normal Meteor ways.  There are no tests, because we like to live dangerously.

## Running the App

```
meteor npm install
meteor
```

## Linting

```
meteor npm run lint
```
